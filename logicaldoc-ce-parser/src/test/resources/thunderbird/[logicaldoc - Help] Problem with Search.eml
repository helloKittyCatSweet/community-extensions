Hello,
I am facing a strange phenomenon in LogicalDoc. I have a document with the title
'testDoc1'. When I search for testDoc1, LogicalDoc finds it, so far so good.
Being curious,  I rename the title of this document to 'testDoc2' directly in
my database (Mysql) and I see that its title has also changed to testDoc2 in
LogicalDoc. Things look good until I want to search for 'testDoc2'. Here starts
the sad story; LD will not find testDoc2 by no means and whats strange is that
when I search 'testDoc1' LD finds the document although such document does not
logically exist in LogicalDoc because I have renamed it to testDoc2.
Any clues?

Regards
