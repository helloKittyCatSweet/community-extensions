Hi there Alessandro,

Thank you very much for the quotation.

I have summarized my client's requirements as follows:

Authentication =96 The ability to verify the identity of the user accessing
documentation

Access Control =96 Ability to limit authenticated users to view or edit onl=
y
those artefacts for which they have been given rights to do so

Non-Repudiation =96 The ability to show without doubt who the person was wh=
o
made changes to a document.

Administration =96 To give a special user or set of users the ability to
manage other users and their rights on the system

Version Control =96 Being able to view or use earlier versions of an artefa=
ct.
This means that not only the current copy is kept, but also previous
versions of the artefact.

Powerful Search =96 Ability to search on name and content of documents.

Safe Storage =96 All artefacts must be well guarded against disaster.
---------

Does logicaldoc cover all these points. From what I have seen it appears so=

Some questions from my side:
- Will I be able to remotely administrate the server (LogicalDOC appliance)=
- What is the storage medium on the LogicalDOC appliance and what type of
redundancy does it profide? Is it a disk array? Is it easy to backup? etc.

If we ordered the LogicalDOC appliance, will it come preconfigured, and wil=
l
I be able to brand the web interface to fit in with the client's existing
logo, and look and feel?

Please come back to me urgently, I need to submit my proposal today stil.

Kind regards,
Jacobus
